Chemotaxis
==========
**[Click here to see the program!](http://noahzpepper.github.io/Chemotaxis)**

Chemotaxis is when an organism moves toward or away from a chemical stimulus like food. Biologists write software using [random walks](http://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis(AndreaSchmidt)/random.htm) to model and study [how very small organisms like bacteria search for food](http://www.mit.edu/~kardar/teaching/projects/chemotaxis(AndreaSchmidt)/). In this assignment you will create a simulation of organisms moving away from a starting position using a random walk. To start the assignment, fork [this repository](https://github.com/APCSLowell/Chemotaxis). You may find slides 241 - 307 on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bz2ZkT6qWPYTVkF4Q19aZ3dfdk0">apjava1.pptx</a> helpful. NOTE: you must use `Math.random()` for all the random numbers in this assignment. 

Requirements
============
This assignment will have a Bacteria class. The class Bacteria will have the following members:
- 3 ints which hold the x and y coordinates of the bacteria position, and the bacteria color.
- A constructor which initializes the 3 ints
- `void move()` which moves the bacteria in a random walk pattern.
- `void show()` which draws the bacteria in the correct position and color  
   
Extensions
==========

If you have extra time, you might try to have the bacteria move in a "biased random walk" towards some stimulus like a piece of food or the mouse. You can modify your class so the bacteria have a finite lifespan and can reproduce. You can also simulate a predator and prey. Your simulation doesn't have to look like any other. Have fun and be creative.
